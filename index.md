[Week 01 - Default Params](/lab/week-01/ES6-review.md)
===============================================================

*This week we'll be reviewing some of the notable ES6 features that were newly introduced in a recently new version of ECMAScript.*

We'll be Looking at:
--------------------
- Default Params 
- Template Strings 
- Object Literals html
- Arrow Functions 
- Promises
- Scoping 
- Classes 
- Modules 
      
[Week 02 - Node Review](/lab/week-02/node-review.md)
===============================================================

*Let's look at some of the things that make Node special this week and get a refresher of our core concepts.*

We'll be Looking at:
--------------------
* Node Core Concepts
* Event Driven Architecture
  * Callbacks
  * Promise
  * Async/Await
* **QUIZ**
* **LAB:** working with ES6 features

[Week 03 - Node For Networking](/lab/week-03/node-for-networking.md)
===============================================================

*Node really shines when we have to work with network requests or any kind of I/O operation. This week we'll be looking at Node can be leveraged  *

We'll be Looking at:
--------------------
* Accessing Local System
  * Buffer Object
* Node for Networking
  * Working with Multiple Sockets
  * Interaction with Socket.IO
* **QUIZ**
* **LAB:** Promises and Async/Await

[Week 04 - Accessing the File System With Node](/lab/week-04/file-system.md)
===============================================================

*Unlike vanilla JS, Node allows us to access the underlying filesystem. We will see how we can interact, modify, creat and work with files using Node.*

We'll be Looking at:
--------------------
* Accessing Local System
  * Process Object and File System
* Clusters and Child Processes
  * The Child Process Module
  * Scaling with the cluster Module
* Testing and Debugging
  * Intro to testing with Mocha
* **QUIZ**
* **LAB:** Socket.IO chat app

[Week 05 - MongoDB and Mongoose](/lab/week-05/mongo.md)
===============================================================

*One advantage of working with Node is that our payloads that we'll be interfacing with we'll be nothing more than Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJO's). We're going to be introducing ourselves to Mongo which is a document store comprised of schema that closely mirrors a JavaScript object. We'll also be looking at Mongoose which is a driver we can import into our source to easily interact with the database.*

We'll be Looking at:
--------------------
* MongoDB and Mongoose
  * Review building schema and Models
  * Query and sorting with Mongoose
  * Methods and statics
* **QUIZ**
* **LAB:** Child Processes and Cluster.

[Week 06 - Mongoose In-Depth](/lab/week-06/mongoose-typescript.md)
===============================================================

*Working with NoSQL can be tricky so we're going to be taking a close look to see how we can implement validators and other safeguards to reduce any DB errors. We'll also be looking at GraphQL and how it's used on the server side and what problems it can help mitigate.*

We'll be Looking at:
--------------------
* Mongoose In-Depth
  * Mongoose Validation
    1. Built-in Validators
    2. Custom Validators
    3. Handling Validation Errors
  * Middleware
* Intro to GraphQL
  * Rest vs GraphQL
  * Setting up GraphQL to work with Express
  * Schemas
  * Types and Queries
* **QUIZ**
* **LAB TEST:** ES6 + Node.js (Feb 14th)
